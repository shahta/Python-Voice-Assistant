# Python-Voice-Assistant
A python app that executes a multitude of commands (checks weather, gets headlines, calorie tracker, etc.) depending on what the user asks or says.

TO use the personal voice assistant, simply download the zip file or clone the repository. Then, run the app and follow the instructions in the terminal.
Also note, when the quit command is used, a message that reads 'Friday shutting down' is displayed. Friday is the name of the voice assistant (kind of like Tony Stark's voice assistant).
